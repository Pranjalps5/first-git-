The Statue of Unity, the world's tallest statue which was erected by the Indian government at a cost of USD420 million, was dedicated to him on 31 October 2018 and is approximately 182 metres (597 ft) in height.[1] He was a barrister and a senior leader of the Indian National Congress, who played a leading role in the country's struggle for independence, guiding its integration into a united, independent nation.[2] He was one of the conservative members of the Indian National Congress. In India and elsewhere, he was often called Sardar, meaning "chief" in Hindi, Urdu, Bengali and Persian. He acted as the Home Minister during the political integration of India and the Indo-Pakistani War of 1947.
